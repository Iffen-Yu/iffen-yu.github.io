<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! -->

======
Lingjun Investment(2023.11 – 2024.2)
- Factor Mining: built momentum factors from the data of volume and open interest for opening and closing a position, built weight factors for position management in specific strategies.

China Futures(2022.11 – 2023.4)
- Factor Rewriting: Numpy vectorization of python code with partial autocorrelation coefficient, continuous wavelet transform, sample entropy, etc., used Numba to achieve code acceleration.
Reproduction and Research of Neural Network Strategies: reproduced AlphaNet and CvxpyLayers neural network and apply to low-frequency trading in CTA, reproduce CNN of price pattern recognition, reproduce Generative Adversarial Network (GAN/WGAN) to simulate financial time series data.
