<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! -->

**Hi, I am Yifeng Yu.**

I am currently a **PhD student** in Department of Mathematical Science at **Tsinghua University** and a **Research Associate** in Data Science at **City University of HongKong**. My research interest lies at the intersection of **Statistical Sampling** and  **Generative AI** .

Specifically, I am fascinated by the theoretical foundations of  **Score-based Diffusion Models** . My goal is to improve the convergence speed and sampling quality of these models through advanced mathematical tools.

Recently, I have been working on the Wasserstein convergence analysis of score-based models, and I am excited to present our latest work at  **NeurIPS 2025** .

Beyond theory, I have extensive experience in  **Quantitative Finance** , applying Deep Learning models (like Transformers and GANs) to decrypt financial market dynamics during my internships at top-tier hedge funds.

### News

* **[Dec 2025]** I attended NeurIPS 2025 at San Diego!
* **[Sep 2025]** I joined City University of Hong Kong as a Research Associate, my supervisor is Prof. Lu Yu.
